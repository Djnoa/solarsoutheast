            <h4>What is Solar South East?</h4>
            <p>Solar South East is a leading provider of solar energy solutions. We're dedicated to offering innovative, high-quality, and affordable solar panels and related services to help residents and businesses across the South East region reduce their energy costs and environmental impact.</p>
            <h4>What services does Solar South East offer?</h4>
            <p>We offer a range of solar services including solar panel installation, system maintenance, solar battery storage solutions, energy efficiency consultations, and solar financing options. We're also dedicated to providing excellent after-sales service and support to our customers.</p>
            <h4> How does solar energy work?</h4> 
            <p>Solar panels convert sunlight into electricity. They're made up of smaller units called photovoltaic cells (or PV cells). When sunlight hits a PV cell, it gets absorbed and its energy knocks electrons loose, creating a flow of electricity. This electricity is then used to power your home or business.</p>
            <h4>Are solar panels efficient in all weather conditions?</h4>
            <p>While solar panels perform best under direct sunlight, they also generate electricity in cloudy weather or indirect light. However, their efficiency might be reduced. In winter or overcast days, your solar system will still produce electricity, just not as much as on a sunny day.</p>
            <h4>How much do solar panels cost?</h4>
            <p>The cost of solar panels can vary depending on the size and type of the system, your energy needs, and your location. At Solar South East, we provide a free initial consultation to determine the best system for your budget and energy requirements.</p>
            <h4>Are there any incentives or rebates for installing solar panels?</h4>
            <p>Yes, the UK government and various energy companies offer schemes that can help offset the cost of installing a solar system. The Smart Export Guarantee (SEG) scheme, for example, requires energy suppliers to pay you for any excess electricity you export back to the grid. Our team at Solar South East is knowledgeable about these schemes and will assist you in understanding and applying for the relevant incentives.</p>
            <h4>How long does it take to install a solar energy system?</h4>
            <p>The typical solar panel installation takes 1-3 days, depending on the size of the system and the conditions of the site. Prior to the installation, there is a period for site assessment, design, permitting, and scheduling.</p>
            <h4>Will solar panels work during a power outage? </h4>
            <p>Solar panels will only work during a power outage if you have a solar battery storage system installed or a solar inverter designed for this purpose. A solar battery stores the excess energy produced by your panels, allowing you to use it when the panels aren't generating power, such as during the night or a power outage.</p>
            
            <h4>What happens if my energy needs change in the future?</h4>
            <p>Our solar energy systems are scalable. If your energy needs increase in the future, additional panels can usually be added. We're always here to advise you on any adjustments to your system.</p>
            <h4>How can I get started with Solar South East?</h4>
            <p>Just get in touch! You can contact us through our website, or give us a call. We will arrange a free consultation to discuss your needs and how solar energy can work best for you.

                For any other inquiries not covered in this FAQ, please feel free to contact our customer service team. We're here to help you make your solar energy journey as smooth as possible.</p>
